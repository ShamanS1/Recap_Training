Create a simple HTML page that includes basic tags and a form to collect user information.

 

The page should have a title "User Information Form."

 

Use appropriate HTML tags to structure the content of the page, including headings, paragraphs, and lists.

 

The form should include the following input fields:

 

First Name (text input)

Last Name (text input)

Email Address (email input)

Date of Birth (date input)

Gender (radio buttons for Male and Female)

Country (select dropdown with at least three country options)

Interests (checkboxes for at least three interest options)

Add a "Submit" button to the form.

 

·        Validate the form to ensure that all required fields are filled out before submission.

 

·        On form submission, display the collected information on the same page below the form, using

appropriate HTML tags and formatting.

 

·        Ensure that the HTML page is well-structured and user-friendly, with clear instructions for filling

out the form. Use appropriate labels for input fields and provide meaningful placeholders or

default values where applicable.

 

Bonus: Implement client-side validation for email format and date of birth to ensure they are entered correctly.
